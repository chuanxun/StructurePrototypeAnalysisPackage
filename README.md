# StructurePrototypeAnalysisPackage
Structure Prototype Analysis Package can analyze symmetry and compare similarity of a large number of atomic structures.

## Description:
Structure Prototype Analysis Package (SPAP) can analyze symmetry and compare similarity of a large number of atomic structures. Typically, SPAP can analyze structures predicted by CALYPSO (www.calypso.cn). We use spglib to analyze symmetry. Coordination Characterization Function (CCF) is used to measure structural similarity.
