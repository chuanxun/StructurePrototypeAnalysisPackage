# StructurePrototypeAnalysisPackage
Structure Prototype Analysis Package can analyze symmetry and compare similarity of a large number of atomic structures.

## Description:
Structure Prototype Analysis Package (SPAP) can analyze symmetry and compare similarity of a large number of atomic structures. Typically, SPAP can analyze structures predicted by CALYPSO (www.calypso.cn). We use spglib to analyze symmetry. Coordination Characterization Function (CCF) is used to measure structural similarity. If you use this program and method in your research, please read and cite the following publication:
